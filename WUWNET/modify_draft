# Abstract
Source localization is a basic problem in ocean acoustics. The matched-field processing(MFP) is a popularly used approach to solve this prolem and there are many researches on it. However, MFP is sensitivity to the mismatch problem and performs well only when the ocean environment is accurately known. 
Machine learning learns inference directly from observation and can be 
designed to learn a generic model suitable for different scenarios.
In this paper, source localization is view as a machine learning problem and a
prediction model was learned by training a sparsely-coded feed-forward neural network with mixed environment model data. Sparsely-coded network is applied for preventing the model from over-learning.
Results on SWellEx96 experiment show that the learned model can achieve a good positioning performance in source range estimation for varying sound speed profiles(ssp).
Machine learning based models are more tolerant and have potential advantages in underwater source localization, compared with conventional MFP method.


# Introduction


Matched-field processing is a frequently used method in underwater acoustics and requires a pretty good knowledge of environment, thus it is sensitive to the model mismatch and performs poorly in unstable and complicated ocean environments\cite{baggeroer1993overview}.
Machine learning based methods can perform a required calculation through learning form examples directly and do not require a good a prior information. We can introduce machine learning to underwater acoustics and help
improving the performance of conventional methods.

A notable recent example of using machine learning method in underwater acoustic is the application of nonlinear classification to source localization\cite{niu2017source}.
In his paper, Niu assumed there existing a deterministic relationship between ship range and sample-covariance matrix and approximated this relationship by the feed-forward neural networks(FNN).
The model performs well on the Noise09 experimental data, which suggests that FNN can achieve a good prediction performance if source localization is solved as a classification problem.

In Niu's work, the neural networks used is dense and the trained model is also sensitive to the mismatch problem. While, dense neural networks can learn a over-complete
representation of input data but need much storage and computation.

Based on Niu's work, this paper trains the feed-forward neural networks with sparse constraint and use data-model mixed training to improve the model tolerance. The model was tested on SWell96 experimental and simulated data.

We can introduce machine learning to underwater acoustics and help
improving the tolerance of conventional methods.

Matched-field processing (MFP) is a common technique used for source localization in an acoustic
wave-guide\cite{bucker1976use,baggeroer1988matched,baggeroer1993overview}. 
MFP localization matches measured acoustic pressure field data on an arrary of sensors with a replica field computed by a numerical propagation model for an assumed source range and depth. The processor output is maximumat at the true source range and depth. However, MFP requires a pretty good knowledge of environment, significant errors in the environment model can be introduced into the 
depth and range localization predictions.\cite{tolstoy1989sensitivity,del1988effects}

Machine learning methods can implement a required calculation through learning form examples and do not require a good a prior information. A well designed network can learn a generic model that works in different kinds of scenarios. This is meaningful for underwater acoustics. We could improve the tolerance of conventional methods by introducing machine learning methods.

Machine learning  methods have obtained success in many areas, such as speech recognition, natural language processing and image processing. There are also applications in underwater acoustics. Previous works had use artificial neural networks to classify whale sounds, locate targets area and discriminate depth. 
A notable recent example of using machine learning methods in underwater acoustic is the application of nonlinear classification to source localization\cite{niu2017source}. It seems there is no discussion on how using machine learning to help solve the mismatch problem in ocean acoustics.

In this paper, the source localization problem is viewed from a machine learning 
framework. As the ssp in the water layer is the most important parameter needed to be known accurately\cite{feuillade1989environmental}, we primary focus on the ssp
mismatch problem. 
Two different degrees of error (a large one and a slight one) in the knowledge of the sound-speed profile were chose to train and test the model.
The large errors has significant chang in shape, while the slight one just has small shift (within 0.5m/s at the same depth) in sound speed.
Effects of such errors on postioning performace for various methods, including Bartlett matched-field processing, matched-covariance estimation and feed-forward neural networks based method, are compared.
Treating different sound speed profiles as different application scenes, a generic model was learned by data-model mixed training. The trained model was tested on 
varying ssp.
In Niu's work\cite{niu2017source}, he used a dense neural networks that performs well on Noise09 experimental data, which verified that FNN can achieve a good prediction performance when source localization is solved as a classification problem. However, as the author said, the FNN classifier will be overfitting and gpredictes poorly when the SNR of training data is low. To overcome this problem, 
a sparsely-coded neural networks was used in this paper. Our models were trained and tested on SWell96 experimental or simulated data.

Based on Niu's work, this paper trains the feed-forward neural networks with sparse constraint and use data-model mixed training to improve the model tolerance. The model was tested on SWell96 experimental and simulated data.


In his paper, Niu assumed there existing a deterministic relationship between ship range and sample-covariance matrix and approximated this relationship by the feed-forward neural networks(FNN).


# Section 2: theory part

# Section 3.5

The simulation results show that training the model using
data collected from different ssp can significantly improve
the tolerance of the classifier, which means FNN can learn
weights over a set of changing ssp.
As discussed in section 3.4, the FNN is also sensitive to
ssp mismatch, but still performs better than Bartlett. When
the environment ssp has a big change in the shape(such as
from ssp-optimized to i906), the performance of the estimator
drops about 40% in accuracy. In this section, by adding data
collected from i906-ssp, the positioning ability of FNN on
i906*(which is little changed from i906,for the sake of testing)
is as better as before. Although the accuracy for i905 has a
little glissade compared with single data training case, the
performance for i906 improved. In general, the trained FNN
classifier works well on both two different shape ssp. Note
that, the legend ’i905,combined’ means the model is trained
by mixed data collected from ssp i906 and ssp optimized,
then the model is tested on ssp i905, rests are similar.






# Conclusion
It is attractive to see that the sparsely-code neural networks
model predicts accurately on source localization, as well as
the dense neural networks do, but needs fewer basis functions
to span the data space. Combined with data-model mixed
training, the model tolerance can be obviously increased, and
performs better in sound speed profile mismatch case than
Bartlett matched-field processing method. Machine learning
methods have potential advantages in unstable underwater
source localization. This paper primarily focus on the fine-
tune for feed-forward neural networks. It deserves more efforts
to apply complicated machine learning methods on ocean
acoustic source localization.

It is attractive to see that the sparsely-code neural network efficiently prevents the model from over-learning and predicts accurately on source localization.
Combined with data-model mixed training, the model tolerance is obviously increased, and performs well in sound speed profile mismatch case, whether  
the degree of error in knowledgelarge is slight or large. 
This is far superior to the Bartlett matched-field processing method.
Machine learning methods have potential advantages in unstable underwater
source localization.

Comparing with dense neural networks, the sparsely-code neural network needs fewer basis functions to span the data space and can make the learned weight coefficient show group structure, which is beneficial to the feature selection.
These mean the learned sparsely-code neural network model can be used not only to predict source localization, but also to describe acoustic pressure field data. This paper only utilizes the prodictive ability of model, the descriptive ability of model need to be further exploited.

Besides, just two degrees of sound-speed profiles mismatch are used to 
examine the data-model mixed training method in this paper, more discussion is needed.

For the aspect of machine learning methods, this paper primarily focus on the fine-tune for feed-forward neural networks.
It deserves more efforts to apply complicated machine learning methods on ocean
acoustic source localization.
