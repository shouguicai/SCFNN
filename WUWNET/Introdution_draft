"Source Localization With Distributed Sensor Arrays and Partial Spatial Coherence"
- Distributed Sensor Arrays
- an array of arrays
- Fig.1 
- narrowband and a wideband
## A standard approach:
	- bearing estimations at individual arrays
	- communication to the fusion center
	- localization at fusion center

	but accuracy will be worse than the optimal solution, 
	the optimal solution requires high communication bandwidth and high processing complexity.

"Distributed Underwater Source Location Estimation Using A MultiArray Network"
- There is increased interest in networking arrays of sensors for source localization

- Some networks that have been studied are:
 > single arrays
 > a sparse distribution of sensors
 > a large array that has been divided into subarrays

 networked with only one arrary(先是这个), mutiarray network（将来会讨论这个）,
 distributedd network with only single sensors on the arrary

- distributed network of sensor arrays 

"Performance Bounds for Multisource Parameter Estimation Using a Multiarray Network"
- Networked sensors are increasingly being used to
perform tasks such as detection, source localization, and tracking
- networked arrays
- source observed by a multiarray network
- Fig.1

the problem of source localization for a single source using distributed sensor arrays was formulated at "Source Localization With Distributed Sensor Arrays and Partial Spatial Coherence" 

"Decentralized Processing in Sensor Arrays"
- passive sensor array processing
- a new scheme for decentralized processing in passive sensor arrays based on communicating the sample-covariance matrices of the subarrays 
- in this method each subarray communicates to the central processor
its sample-covariance matrix, we go further, our method just communicate a sparse of scm to the fusion center
- the optimal solution to this problem involves a centralized and coherent
processing of all the sensor outputs (see Schweppe (1968) and Wax and Kailath (1983a)),  but in the case of large arrays,  this centralized scheme is unattractive
> accuracy improved, but this method  increase the communication load 

- To alleviate the communication burden:
 > one may trade off performance for communication load
 >  data reduction, only a small number of parameters has to be communicated from every subarray. 

 - communication load : triangulation scheme < Decentralized Processing in Sensor Arrays < centralized scheme
 our fnn method must < Decentralized Processing in Sensor Arrays
 - shown to provide better accuracy than that offered by the conventional mfp
